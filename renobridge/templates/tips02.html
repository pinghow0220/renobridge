                <p class="card-text">
                    Regardless of the type and size of the property, most homeowners always give all their effort into the
                    design so that it matches their preferences and senses. Even within the limitations of the usual
                    narrow-fronted terrace buildings, homeowners are still able to express their stylistic preferences.
                    Modern home design has been greatly impacted by the idea of minimalism, which emphasizes utility,
                    uniformity, and simplicity. One of the essential components of minimalist design is color palette in
                    Neutral Tones. It's common to employ a monochromatic or neutral color scheme to convey peace and
                    tranquillity. Shades of white, beige, grey, or blue can be included in this.

                    Although the interior design market is dominated by the minimalistic look, bold accents might be favorable
                    to certain homeowners. While preserving the general simplicity and elegance of the minimalist design,
                    these accents are carefully placed throughout areas to offer personality and visual interest. Some of
