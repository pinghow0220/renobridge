                            This is where everything begins. Homeowners first need to set goals and evaluate what needs to be renovated. For instance, the goals can be expanding the area, modernizing the design, or enhancing functionality. Next, homeowners may need to do their calculations, estimating the budgets and duration available for the renovation, considering their available financial ability.

                            Homeowners create a thorough strategy for their renovation during this phase, which includes finding an interior designer and contractor. Homeowners will first get quotes from different professionals, compare among themselves, discuss their ideas, and perform negotiations of their allocated budget and time. In addition, they must identify and compare the required materials from different suppliers. At the end of the planning stage, a license must be obtained from the government to ensure that the upcoming renovation process can be performed smoothly.

                            This phase is all about making decisions on the design and choosing materials. Homeowners are required to work closely with their interior designers in their selection of paint, hardware, colour preferences, and other design components. All these decisions will then be informed to the contractors and subcontractors to gain advice on technical feasibility. With the rapid growth of technology, plenty of tools are now available to assist homeowners in decision-making, lessening their burden on making analyses and comparisons in this stage.

                            Real construction and material installation take place during this phase, which consumes most of the duration of the entire renovation progress. Several procedures must be followed, including demolition, framing, plumbing, electrical, and cabinet installation. In this phase, all parties involved, including homeowners, designers, and contractors, must collaborate and communicate efficiently to produce the desired outcome for the homeowners. At the same time, homeowners have to keep an eye on the renovation progress and expenses to prevent delays and over-budgeting throughout the process.
